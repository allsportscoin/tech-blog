The odds calculation formula for a single match:

The total value of the win = the value of all address wins

The total value of the flattening = the value of all addresses flattened

The total value of the negative = the value of all addresses negative

Total value of bet = The total value of the win + The total value of the flattening + The total value of the negative
winning odds  = Total bet value / The total value of the win
Flattened odds = Total bet value / The total value of the flattening
Impulsive odds = Total bet value / The total value of the negative
Inflation amount allocation = (win/flat/negative) odds* pressure value
